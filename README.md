RBAC

Overview

This project is a simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system designed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It focuses on implementing secure user authentication and authorization while managing different roles like Admin, User, and Moderator.

The goal is to demonstrate a secure backend system that limits access to specific resources based on roles.


Features

Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.

Role-Based Authorization:

Admins have access to administrative routes.

Users have restricted access to certain endpoints.


Secure Password Management: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.js.

JWT for Session Management: Tokens are used to authenticate and manage user sessions.

Environment Configuration: Credentials are managed securely using a .env file.

Technologies Used

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JWT

Password Hashing: bcrypt.js

Environment Variables: dotenv

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

Node.js (v14 or later)

MongoDB (Local or cloud instance)



---

Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Hifzatul1/rbac.git
cd rbac


2. Install Dependencies

npm install


3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory.

Add the following:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret



4. Run the Application

npm run dev


5. Open your browser and access the server at http://localhost:5000.

Troubleshooting

Common Issues

1. Error: Cannot connect to MongoDB

Ensure your MongoDB connection string in .env is correct.

Verify that MongoDB is running locally or that your cloud instance is accessible.



2. Error: Module not found

Ensure all required files exist in the correct structure (e.g., app.js, db.js).

Run npm install to reinstall dependencies.



3. "Failed to push some refs to origin"

If this occurs when pushing to GitHub, pull the remote changes first:

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories





---

Future Enhancements

Add Refresh Tokens for extended session management.

Implement 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for added security.

Integrate a frontend using React.js or Angular.
